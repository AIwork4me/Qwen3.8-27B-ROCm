# "No space left on device". The download and the extraction can target
# different filesystems ($TMPDIR vs the prefix parent), so each is checked
# against its own worst case:
#   - the archive filesystem must hold the tarball: the manifest's own
#     size_bytes (1,713,449,440 = ~1.6 GiB for ROCm 7.14.0);
#   - the prefix filesystem must hold the extracted tree: the manifest has no

#     (an 8.3 GiB ~/rocm-7.14.0 tree from the 1.6 GiB tarball), rounded up to
#     9 GiB to stay honest across patch releases.
# When both paths sit on ONE filesystem, the true peak is the archive and the
# extracted tree coexisting during tar, so the floors are combined and
